# Marc Wigzell Experian Assesssment
* Run "tar_script.R" which should install packages and make() the targets plan
* Unfortunately during exploratory analysis I realised targets() is overkill as
  something like this doesn't need to be productionised.
* eda.Rmd contains my solutions, I perfomed k-prototypes clustering and
  suggest some coffees for each person from within these clusters.
